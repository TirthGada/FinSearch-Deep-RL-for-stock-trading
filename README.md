# FinSearch-Deep-RL-for-stock-trading

This implementation employs deep reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize
a stock trading strategy with the goal of maximizing investment return. The
methodology involves creating an RL environment that simulates stock trading,
developing a deep Q-network (DQN) agent to learn optimal trading decisions,
and conducting a training loop to iteratively improve the agentâ€™s performance.



## END TERM REPORT
Use deep reinforcement learning (RL) to optimise stock trading strategy and thus maximise investment return.

Develop reinforcement learning (RL) and benchmark models utilising either ARIMA or LSTL approaches, and conduct a comprehensive performance analysis encompassing both returns and risk factors. Evaluate these models using past 6 weeks Nifty100 data. Provide a code implementation (using a programming language of your choice) along with a write-up comprising essential literature references (a minimum of 8-10), an outline of the methodology employed, a description of the data utilised, and a presentation of the obtained results.
